<h1> Meteorite Data using Redis and Flask </h1>
This project uses one data set containing a multitude of meteorite landing site data to observe.
The goal of this project is to create a container which launches a Redis database server that can be used to load data and get data by using another application Flask. Flask is contained in a Dockerfile that makes setup of the containters much easier.
